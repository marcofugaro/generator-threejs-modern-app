## Usage

Once you installed the dependencies running `yarn`, these are the available commands:

- `yarn start` starts a server locally
- `yarn build` builds the project for production, ready to be deployed from the `build/` folder

All the build tools logic is in the `package.json` and `webpack.config.js`.
